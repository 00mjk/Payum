# Want to store payments somewhere?

There are two storage supported out of the box. [doctrine2](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Bridge/Doctrine/Storage/DoctrineStorage.php)([offsite](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)) and [filesystem](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Storage/FilesystemStorage.php).
The filesystem storage is easy to setup, does not have any requirements. It is expected to be used more in tests.

Want another storage? Contribute!
